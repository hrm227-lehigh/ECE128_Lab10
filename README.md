This is the repository for Cesar and Hardhik's implementation of the ECE128 Lab 10 design. This lab consisted of implementing a control unit, ROM, RAM, multiplier, and register file to create a top module capable of reading data from ROM, multiplying it, and storing the result in RAM. For the design source, add the "lab10_top.v" file. For the simulation source, add the "lab10_top_tb.v" file. Ensure the appropriate file is enabled for running synthesis, implementation, bitstream generation, and waveform generation. Analyzing the waveform of the testbench will provide the most insight into the validity of the module designs. For using the Basys3 with our design, the furthest six switches to the right represent input A and input B; these inputs are 3 bits that correspond to an address in ROM. In the ROM file, we have values stored to numerous 3-bit addresses. The LEDs above the switches represent the product (in binary) of the two values specified by the switch inputs.
